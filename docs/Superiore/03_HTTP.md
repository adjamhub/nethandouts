BASE: https://httpwg.org/specs/

The “core” semantics of the HTTP protocol are defined by:

    RFC9110: HTTP Semantics
    RFC9111: HTTP Caching

Those semantics are expressed “on the wire” in three ways:

    RFC9112: HTTP/1.1
    RFC9113: HTTP/2
    RFC9114: HTTP/3

ULTIMO -----> HTTPS!!!

E poi vai...
